🌟 Day 1: Kicking Off My 50 Days LeetCode Milestone Challenge! 🚀

Hey everyone! 👋 I'm excited to announce that today marks the beginning of my 50-day LeetCode milestone challenge. My goal is to sharpen my problem-solving skills and deepen my understanding of algorithms and data structures. Below are the details of what I tackled on Day 1.

Contents:
1. Q75. Sort Colors (The Dutch National Flag Problem)
    - Problem Statement: Given an array with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.
    - Approaches:
        - Two-pointer Approach: Using two pointers to partition the array into three sections, efficiently sorting the colors in one pass.
        - Counting Approach: Counting the occurrences of each color and then overwriting the array based on the count.
      
2. Q189. Rotate Array
    - Problem Statement: Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.
    - Approach:
        - Modulus Approach: Using the formula (index + k) % n, I determined the new position of each element after rotation.

Why This Matters:
Practicing these types of problems on LeetCode helps in developing a deeper understanding of essential algorithms and data structures, which is crucial for acing technical interviews and improving coding skills.

Repository Structure:
- `sort_colors.cpp`: Contains the code for solving Q75. Sort Colors using both the Two-pointer and Counting approaches.
- `rotate_array.cpp`: Contains the code for solving Q189. Rotate Array using the Modulus approach.
- `README.md`: This readme file explaining the purpose and usage of the code files.

How to Use:
- Explore the code examples in the respective files to understand the approaches used to solve these problems.
- Use these examples as a reference for your own projects and studies.


Feel free to star ⭐️ and fork 🍴 the repository to keep these resources handy. Contributions and discussions are welcome!

Let's empower each other with knowledge and ace those interviews! 💪

Happy coding! 💻✨
